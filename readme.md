# Automatic Imp Maps Downloader:Next

The previous version of AIMD died after the maplist API stopped working. This version is much simpler and less can go wrong.

Simply run the .exe and it will check the current map and next map to see if you need them.

Your TF2 install location should be found automatically, if it isn't you will be instructed to provide the URI.

While it is running a folder called `temp` will be created, files that are being downloaded and those being unzipped will be in there, they should be cleared up once they have been moved over. This folder can be cleared/deleted after the program has been closed without any ill effects.
